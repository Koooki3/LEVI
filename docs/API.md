# LEVI API

Use the frontend origin, normally `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. The runtime bridge forwards local operations to the loopback FastAPI service; byte Range and HEAD are supported. This is a single-user service, not a public multi-tenant API.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/levi/catalog` | Local registrations, demo IDs, workspace and available conversion stages |
| POST | `/api/levi/catalog` | Register `{ "path": "/workspace/dataset" }` |
| GET / HEAD | `/api/levi/files/{slug}/{relative_path}` | Registered dataset metadata, Parquet, images or MP4; confined to dataset root |
| GET | `/api/levi/review?repo_id=org/name` | Restore saved review |
| POST | `/api/levi/review` | Save `{ "repo_id": "…", "flagged": [0,2], "notes": "…" }` |
| GET | `/api/levi/review/export?repo_id=org/name` | Download `levi.review.v1` JSON |
| POST | `/api/levi/jobs/plan` | Preview `{ "stage": "pipeline", "source": "captures/session-a", "fps": 10, "source_fps": 30, "options": {} }` |
| POST | `/api/levi/jobs/{id}/run` | Consume the stored plan once; body `{}` |
| GET | `/api/levi/jobs` | Latest 50 plans/jobs and up to 32 KB of each log tail |
| POST | `/api/levi/diagnostics` | Diagnose `{ "repo_id": "…", "max_episodes": 20, "checks": ["metadata","temporal"], "decode_video": false }` |
| GET | `/api/annotation/health` | Annotation service availability |
| POST | `/api/annotation/dataset/load` | Load `{ "repo_id": "…" }` or `{ "local_path": "/workspace/dataset" }` |
| GET | `/api/annotation/episodes/{id}/atoms?repo_id=…` | Read language atoms |
| POST | `/api/annotation/episodes/{id}/atoms` | Replace `{ "repo_id": "…", "episode_index": 0, "atoms": [...] }` |
| GET | `/api/annotation/episodes/{id}/frame_timestamps?repo_id=…` | Exact source timestamps |
| POST | `/api/annotation/export` | New annotated tree; optional `output_dir`, `copy_videos` |
| POST | `/api/annotation/push_to_hub` | Explicit export and upload using the upstream backend implementation |

For the `local/<slug>` repo IDs returned by registration, the annotation API resolves the registered directory automatically. Direct `local_path` also works if it remains inside the configured workspace.

### Annotation example

```json
{
  "repo_id": "local/registered-id",
  "episode_index": 0,
  "atoms": [
    {"role":"user","content":"Reach for the strawberry","style":"subtask","timestamp":0.0},
    {"role":"user","content":"Pause here","style":"interjection","timestamp":1.2}
  ]
}
```

The upstream VQA answer JSON and `tool_calls` structures are preserved; use the UI to create grounded annotations correctly. Invalid styles and atoms are rejected by the annotation validator.

### Explicit Hub upload

`POST /api/annotation/push_to_hub` accepts `repo_id` or `local_path`, `hf_token`, `push_in_place`, `new_repo_id`, `private`, `commit_message`. Prefer a new target repository and set `push_in_place=false`. A write-capable token is required. No upload is performed by ordinary browsing, diagnostics, annotation saves or conversion. Never include a real token in a committed example or terminal log.

### Error handling

- `400`: invalid source, stage, check name or workspace boundary.
- `403`: disallowed asset or browser cross-origin write.
- `404`: unknown plan, missing file or dataset metadata.
- `409`: output already exists, or export would overlap the source.
- `413`: frontend bridge request body exceeds 16 MiB.
- `422`: typed request validation failed.
- `502`: local backend is unavailable; start both services with the uv launcher.

Diagnostic calls are synchronous and can take time to download remote shards. Conversion calls return a background job. Concurrent editing of the same dataset by multiple users is outside the single-user model; deploy separate workspaces/processes when isolation is needed.

### Built-in conversion plans

`catalog` reports `conversion_engine=levi.builtin.v1`, `conversion_available` (ffmpeg/ffprobe), and all bundled stages. `JobPlan.options` uses the strict schema documented in [CONVERSION.md](CONVERSION.md); unknown keys and invalid values are rejected. Top-level FPS fields override FPS entries in options.

Plans capture source size/mtime fingerprints. Execution fails if the source changes before or during processing. The worker is always `python -m levi.conversion`; old external-script plans cannot run. Job results include `exit_code`, structured `result`, `output_exists`, and an automatically registered `dataset` when successful. `pipeline` updates the job output to its nested validated `dataset/` directory. Intermediate captures remain in the run directory.

Read-only stages have no output dataset. A failing report exits with code 2 and is recorded as failed; exceptions exit nonzero. Interrupted jobs are marked on service restart; partial output is retained, never resumed automatically.
